You may contact ET to request access to a restricted site or to report that a site was restricted in error. ASU may restrict you from accessing ASU Computing and Communication Resources.  and web pages may be used only for ASU business and only authorized individuals may modify or post materials to these pages. No other pages may suggest that they are ASU web pages. If confusion is possible, pages should contain a disclaimer and links to ASU sites. By posting materials and using ASU Computing and Communication Resources, each User represents that he or she has created the materials or that he or she has the right to post or use the materials. The storage, posting, or transmission of materials must not violate the rights of any third person in the materials, including copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, and any rights of publicity or privacy of any person. Materials posted must not be defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or obscene. ASU Computing and Communication Resources may not be used for unauthorized commercial purposes. The use of ASU Computing and Communications Resources, including ASU’s website is at the sole discretion of ASU. ASU does not guarantee that any User will have continued or uninterrupted access to ASU’s website. ASU’s website may be removed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of ASU in accordance with ASU policy, or as needed to maintain the continued operation or integrity of ASU Computing and Communication Resources. ASU makes reasonable efforts to protect the integrity of its technology network and related services, but ASU cannot guarantee backup, disaster recovery, or User access to information posted on web pages or personal computers. Access to ASU e-mail is a privilege that may be wholly or partially restricted without prior notice and without consent of the User: a) If required by applicable law or policy; b) If a reasonable suspicion exists that there has been or may be a violation of law, regulation, or policy; or c) If required to protect the integrity or operation of ASU’s e-mail system or Computing and Communication Resources or when ASU Computing and Communication Resources are required for more critical tasks, as determined by appropriate management authority. Access to ASU’s e-mail system may require approval of the appropriate ASU supervisory or management authority (e.g., department head, system administrator, etc.). ASU may permit the inspection, monitoring, or disclosure of e-mail, computer files, and network transmissions when: a) Required or permitted by law, (including public records laws), subpoenas, or court orders; b) ASU or its designated agent reasonably believes that a violation of law or policy has occurred; or c) Necessary to monitor and preserve the functioning and integrity of the e-mail system or ASU Computing and Communications Resources. You must cooperate and comply with ASU requests for access to and copies of e-mail messages or data when access or disclosure is authorized by these Terms of Use or required or allowed by law or other applicable policies. If ASU believes unauthorized access to or disclosure of information has occurred or will occur, ASU will make reasonable efforts to inform the affected computer   holder, except when notification is impractical or when notification would be detrimental to an investigation of a violation of law or policy. Activities that may strain ASU’s e-mail or Computing and Communication Resources more than can be reasonably expected are in violation of these Terms of Use. These activities include, but are not limited to: sending chain letters; “spam,” or the widespread dissemination of unsolicited e-mail; and “letter bombs” to resend the same e-mail repeatedly to one or more recipients. Confidentiality of e-mail and other network transmissions cannot be assured. Therefore, you must exercise caution when sending personal, financial, confidential, or sensitive information by e-mail or via ASU Computing and Communications Resources. Most electronic information (e.g., e-mail) produced in the course of ASU business is considered an Arizona public record, and must be stored or deleted in accordance with  . Consult with ASU’s archivist for guidance on procedures for external storage or deletion of public records. Certain central service and network activities from workstations connected to the network are routinely logged and monitored.

In cases of suspected violations of ASU policies, especially unauthorized access to ASU Computing and Communication Resources, the appropriate system administrator, after consultation with ET or other ASU offices if appropriate, may authorize detailed session logging. This may involve a complete keystroke log of an entire session. In addition, the system administrator of the facility concerned may authorize limited searching of User files to gather evidence on a suspected violation. Software and physical limitations, computer viruses, and third-party intrusions can compromise security of data storage and communications. ASU takes reasonable precautions to minimize risk. Users must notify appropriate ASU officials including their immediate supervisor and ET of information security concerns including, but not limited to, breaches of sensitive data or compromised accounts. ASU Computing and Communication Resources are managed by Users, ASU departments, or ET, depending on a variety of business factors. ET is not obligated to maintain backups of any file for any particular length of time. Users must protect and back up critical data. Individual Users and departments should develop policies and practices, coordinated with ET as needed, to ensure regular backups of data and to implement steps to ensure that all critical data is compatible with all current generations of computing equipment, storage media, and media readers. All ASU departments should ensure that access to sensitive data is restricted to those employees who have a need to access the information. Passwords that provide access to sensitive information should be changed on a regular basis. ASU Computing and Communication Resources may be examined to detect illegal content, to evaluate the security of the network, and to detect violations of Arizona Board of Regents and ASU policies. Networks, networked devices, and applications may be scanned for vulnerabilities as authorized by ET. Any actual or suspected violation of these Terms of Use should be brought to the ASU system administrator of the equipment or facility most directly involved. In the case of a serious violation, Users are required to make a report to  Upon receiving notice of a violation, ASU may temporarily suspend your privileges, move, or delete the allegedly offending material pending further proceedings. A User accused of a violation will be notified of the charge and have an opportunity to respond before ASU imposes a permanent sanction. Appropriate cases will be referred to the ASU disciplinary authority appropriate to the violator’s status (e.g., Office of Student Life or employee’s supervisor) or to appropriate law enforcement authorities. In addition to sanctions available under applicable law and ASU and ABOR policies, ASU may impose a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of   to ASU Computing and Communication Resources, and other services or facilities. If ASU believes it necessary to preserve the integrity of Computing and Communication Resources or data, ASU may temporarily suspend any account, whether or not the account User is suspected of any violation.

https://www.asu.edu/about/terms-of-use#cardBodyrankings,2,Terms of Use | Arizona State University,ASU’s Commitment to Sustainability,1716,11145,"These Terms of Use apply to all uses and users ( ) of ASU’s computing, Internet, and communication resources ( ). ASU Computing and Communication Resources include ASU’s websites and information posted thereon, software and online services provided by ASU, including through the cloud, and ASU’s technology network, and communications and computing devices. ASU Computing and Communication Resources also include computers, data storage systems, mobile devices, electronic data, networks, electronic mail services, electronic information sources, voice mail, telephone services, and other communication resources. In addition, these Terms of Use reflect the goal of ASU to foster academic freedom while respecting the principles of freedom of speech and the privacy rights of Users. ASU Computing and Communication Resources are the property of ASU. They are to be used for the advancement of ASU’s educational, research, service, community outreach, administrative, and business purposes. ASU’s Computing and Communication Resources are provided for the use of faculty, staff, currently admitted or enrolled students, and other properly authorized Users. ASU may, at its discretion, permit Users to have the access to accounts and e-mail forwarded or redirected for a limited period of time. Enterprise Technology (ET) is responsible for the maintenance and security of ASU’s central computing and communications resources. This includes recommendations for effective practices by its Users, These Terms of Use are designed to aid the ASU community in protecting the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of ASU Computing and Communication Resources. All uses and Users of ASU Computing and Communication Resources must comply with these Terms of Use, as well as   and  . All uses of ASU Computing and Communication Resources must also be consistent with  . We encourage you to periodically review these Terms of Use because ASU may update them from time to time. ASU may restrict access from within its network to any sites in furtherance of these Terms of Use. You may contact ET to request access to a restricted site or to report that a site was restricted in error. ASU may restrict you from accessing ASU Computing and Communication Resources.  and web pages may be used only for ASU business and only authorized individuals may modify or post materials to these pages. No other pages may suggest that they are ASU web pages. If confusion is possible, pages should contain a disclaimer and links to ASU sites. By posting materials and using ASU Computing and Communication Resources, each User represents that he or she has created the materials or that he or she has the right to post or use the materials. The storage, posting, or transmission of materials must not violate the rights of any third person in the materials, including copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, and any rights of publicity or privacy of any person. Materials posted must not be defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or obscene. ASU Computing and Communication Resources may not be used for unauthorized commercial purposes. The use of ASU Computing and Communications Resources, including ASU’s website is at the sole discretion of ASU. ASU does not guarantee that any User will have continued or uninterrupted access to ASU’s website. ASU’s website may be removed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of ASU in accordance with ASU policy, or as needed to maintain the continued operation or integrity of ASU Computing and Communication Resources. ASU makes reasonable efforts to protect the integrity of its technology network and related services, but ASU cannot guarantee backup, disaster recovery, or User access to information posted on web pages or personal computers. Access to ASU e-mail is a privilege that may be wholly or partially restricted without prior notice and without consent of the User: a) If required by applicable law or policy; b) If a reasonable suspicion exists that there has been or may be a violation of law, regulation, or policy; or c) If required to protect the integrity or operation of ASU’s e-mail system or Computing and Communication Resources or when ASU Computing and Communication Resources are required for more critical tasks, as determined by appropriate management authority. Access to ASU’s e-mail system may require approval of the appropriate ASU supervisory or management authority (e.g., department head, system administrator, etc.). ASU may permit the inspection, monitoring, or disclosure of e-mail, computer files, and network transmissions when: a) Required or permitted by law, (including public records laws), subpoenas, or court orders; b) ASU or its designated agent reasonably believes that a violation of law or policy has occurred; or c) Necessary to monitor and preserve the functioning and integrity of the e-mail system or ASU Computing and Communications Resources. You must cooperate and comply with ASU requests for access to and copies of e-mail messages or data when access or disclosure is authorized by these Terms of Use or required or allowed by law or other applicable policies. If ASU believes unauthorized access to or disclosure of information has occurred or will occur, ASU will make reasonable efforts to inform the affected computer   holder, except when notification is impractical or when notification would be detrimental to an investigation of a violation of law or policy. Activities that may strain ASU’s e-mail or Computing and Communication Resources more than can be reasonably expected are in violation of these Terms of Use. These activities include, but are not limited to: sending chain letters; “spam,” or the widespread dissemination of unsolicited e-mail; and “letter bombs” to resend the same e-mail repeatedly to one or more recipients. Confidentiality of e-mail and other network transmissions cannot be assured. Therefore, you must exercise caution when sending personal, financial, confidential, or sensitive information by e-mail or via ASU Computing and Communications Resources. Most electronic information (e.g., e-mail) produced in the course of ASU business is considered an Arizona public record, and must be stored or deleted in accordance with  . Consult with ASU’s archivist for guidance on procedures for external storage or deletion of public records. Certain central service and network activities from workstations connected to the network are routinely logged and monitored. These activities include but are not limited to: a) Use of passwords and   accessed; b) Time and duration of network activity; c) Access to Web pages; d) Access to network software; e) Volume of data storage and transfers; and f) Server space used for e-mail. In cases of suspected violations of ASU policies, especially unauthorized access to ASU Computing and Communication Resources, the appropriate system administrator, after consultation with ET or other ASU offices if appropriate, may authorize detailed session logging. This may involve a complete keystroke log of an entire session. In addition, the system administrator of the facility concerned may authorize limited searching of User files to gather evidence on a suspected violation. Software and physical limitations, computer viruses, and third-party intrusions can compromise security of data storage and communications. ASU takes reasonable precautions to minimize risk. Users must notify appropriate ASU officials including their immediate supervisor and ET of information security concerns including, but not limited to, breaches of sensitive data or compromised accounts. ASU Computing and Communication Resources are managed by Users, ASU departments, or ET, depending on a variety of business factors. ET is not obligated to maintain backups of any file for any particular length of time. Users must protect and back up critical data. Individual Users and departments should develop policies and practices, coordinated with ET as needed, to ensure regular backups of data and to implement steps to ensure that all critical data is compatible with all current generations of computing equipment, storage media, and media readers. All ASU departments should ensure that access to sensitive data is restricted to those employees who have a need to access the information. Passwords that provide access to sensitive information should be changed on a regular basis. ASU Computing and Communication Resources may be examined to detect illegal content, to evaluate the security of the network, and to detect violations of Arizona Board of Regents and ASU policies. Networks, networked devices, and applications may be scanned for vulnerabilities as authorized by ET. Any actual or suspected violation of these Terms of Use should be brought to the ASU system administrator of the equipment or facility most directly involved. In the case of a serious violation, Users are required to make a report to  Upon receiving notice of a violation, ASU may temporarily suspend your privileges, move, or delete the allegedly offending material pending further proceedings. A User accused of a violation will be notified of the charge and have an opportunity to respond before ASU imposes a permanent sanction. Appropriate cases will be referred to the ASU disciplinary authority appropriate to the violator’s status (e.g., Office of Student Life or employee’s supervisor) or to appropriate law enforcement authorities. In addition to sanctions available under applicable law and ASU and ABOR policies, ASU may impose a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of   to ASU Computing and Communication Resources, and other services or facilities. If ASU believes it necessary to preserve the integrity of Computing and Communication Resources or data, ASU may temporarily suspend any account, whether or not the account User is suspected of any violation. ASU will provide appropriate notice to the User. Servers and computers that threaten the security of ASU Computing and Communication Resources will be removed from the network and allowed to reconnect only with the approval of ET. Unless you are an ASU employee acting within the course and scope of your employment with ASU, you agree to indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless the State of Arizona, its departments, agencies, boards, commissions, universities, and its and their officials, agents and employees for, from, and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including court costs, attorneys’ fees, and costs of claim processing, investigation, and litigation) for bodily injury or personal injury (including death), or loss or damage to tangible or intangible property to the extent caused, or alleged to be caused, by (i) the User’s negligence, acts or omissions; (ii) a breach of these Terms of Use; or (iii) failure to comply with any applicable law. You will be responsible for primary loss investigation, defense and judgment costs where this indemnification is applicable.

The storage, posting, or transmission of materials must not violate the rights of any third person in the materials, including copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, and any rights of publicity or privacy of any person. Materials posted must not be defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or obscene. ASU Computing and Communication Resources may not be used for unauthorized commercial purposes. The use of ASU Computing and Communications Resources, including ASU’s website is at the sole discretion of ASU. ASU does not guarantee that any User will have continued or uninterrupted access to ASU’s website. ASU’s website may be removed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of ASU in accordance with ASU policy, or as needed to maintain the continued operation or integrity of ASU Computing and Communication Resources. ASU makes reasonable efforts to protect the integrity of its technology network and related services, but ASU cannot guarantee backup, disaster recovery, or User access to information posted on web pages or personal computers. Access to ASU e-mail is a privilege that may be wholly or partially restricted without prior notice and without consent of the User: a) If required by applicable law or policy; b) If a reasonable suspicion exists that there has been or may be a violation of law, regulation, or policy; or c) If required to protect the integrity or operation of ASU’s e-mail system or Computing and Communication Resources or when ASU Computing and Communication Resources are required for more critical tasks, as determined by appropriate management authority. Access to ASU’s e-mail system may require approval of the appropriate ASU supervisory or management authority (e.g., department head, system administrator, etc.). ASU may permit the inspection, monitoring, or disclosure of e-mail, computer files, and network transmissions when: a) Required or permitted by law, (including public records laws), subpoenas, or court orders; b) ASU or its designated agent reasonably believes that a violation of law or policy has occurred; or c) Necessary to monitor and preserve the functioning and integrity of the e-mail system or ASU Computing and Communications Resources.

Activities that may strain ASU’s e-mail or Computing and Communication Resources more than can be reasonably expected are in violation of these Terms of Use. These activities include, but are not limited to: sending chain letters; “spam,” or the widespread dissemination of unsolicited e-mail; and “letter bombs” to resend the same e-mail repeatedly to one or more recipients. Confidentiality of e-mail and other network transmissions cannot be assured. Therefore, you must exercise caution when sending personal, financial, confidential, or sensitive information by e-mail or via ASU Computing and Communications Resources. Most electronic information (e.g., e-mail) produced in the course of ASU business is considered an Arizona public record, and must be stored or deleted in accordance with  . Consult with ASU’s archivist for guidance on procedures for external storage or deletion of public records.

These activities include but are not limited to: a) Use of passwords and   accessed; b) Time and duration of network activity; c) Access to Web pages; d) Access to network software; e) Volume of data storage and transfers; and f) Server space used for e-mail. In cases of suspected violations of ASU policies, especially unauthorized access to ASU Computing and Communication Resources, the appropriate system administrator, after consultation with ET or other ASU offices if appropriate, may authorize detailed session logging. This may involve a complete keystroke log of an entire session. In addition, the system administrator of the facility concerned may authorize limited searching of User files to gather evidence on a suspected violation. Software and physical limitations, computer viruses, and third-party intrusions can compromise security of data storage and communications. ASU takes reasonable precautions to minimize risk. Users must notify appropriate ASU officials including their immediate supervisor and ET of information security concerns including, but not limited to, breaches of sensitive data or compromised accounts. ASU Computing and Communication Resources are managed by Users, ASU departments, or ET, depending on a variety of business factors. ET is not obligated to maintain backups of any file for any particular length of time. Users must protect and back up critical data. Individual Users and departments should develop policies and practices, coordinated with ET as needed, to ensure regular backups of data and to implement steps to ensure that all critical data is compatible with all current generations of computing equipment, storage media, and media readers. All ASU departments should ensure that access to sensitive data is restricted to those employees who have a need to access the information. Passwords that provide access to sensitive information should be changed on a regular basis. ASU Computing and Communication Resources may be examined to detect illegal content, to evaluate the security of the network, and to detect violations of Arizona Board of Regents and ASU policies. Networks, networked devices, and applications may be scanned for vulnerabilities as authorized by ET. Any actual or suspected violation of these Terms of Use should be brought to the ASU system administrator of the equipment or facility most directly involved. In the case of a serious violation, Users are required to make a report to  Upon receiving notice of a violation, ASU may temporarily suspend your privileges, move, or delete the allegedly offending material pending further proceedings. A User accused of a violation will be notified of the charge and have an opportunity to respond before ASU imposes a permanent sanction. Appropriate cases will be referred to the ASU disciplinary authority appropriate to the violator’s status (e.g., Office of Student Life or employee’s supervisor) or to appropriate law enforcement authorities. In addition to sanctions available under applicable law and ASU and ABOR policies, ASU may impose a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of   to ASU Computing and Communication Resources, and other services or facilities. If ASU believes it necessary to preserve the integrity of Computing and Communication Resources or data, ASU may temporarily suspend any account, whether or not the account User is suspected of any violation.
