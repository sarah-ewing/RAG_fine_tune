The dendrogram can then be used to identify groups of word stems that are closely clustered together, implying that these word stems frequently occur together in similar contexts, and are therefore likely to be correlated with specific GOMS primitives.

The arrows in the figure are at different angles to one another , indicating the level of correlation. When the arrows are at 90 degrees, this indicates orthogonality, or a lack of correlation between word stems. And parallel arrows are considered to be highly correlated. Arrows at 180 degrees from one another are inversely related. Based on this, words like follow and perform are considered essentially parallel. Check and drain are 180 degrees from each other , indicating an inverse relationship. While this method provide s informative descriptive statistics and dimension reduction, identifying the stems that are strongly correlated with the GOMS primitives is not straight forward in this form. Thus , other methods were considered for auto calculating GOMS primitives to NPP procedures. Single Value Decompositi on. SVD is a statistical method to reduce the noise of irrelevant variables. SVD describes data by reducing the sum of the difference between the text matrix vectors , the details of which are described in 15 . The positive aspect is that SVD does not over rate the similarity between two words, in contrast to the PCA approach. Unlike other methods , SVD does not automatically toss out highly correlated word stems . However, the output for SVD is similar to that of PCA and as such was not utilized as a method to reduce dimensions in GOMS. Expert Opinion . While the previously defined methods for noise reduction in the number of word stems may be more descriptive, their implications are not always straightforward. As such , expert opinion was employed that involved dropping all the word stems that had three or less occurrences. Three was decided upon because it was the median number of occurrence s of word stems in the codex . This resulted in 84 word stems remaining in the text matr ix. Further dimension and noise reduction was completed using analytical techniques, with unique results being applied to each GOMS primitive type . 3.2 Analysis Methods The results of the analysis provide word stems that are strongly correlated with GOMS primitive s. The methods considered include naive Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, heat map algorithms, E uclidian hierarchical cl ustering EHC , correlation networks , and Bayesian discrete discrimina nt BDD analysis. Details from EH C, correlation network, and BDD are provided below . Euclidian Hierarchical Clustering . The first step to EHC is to calculate the distance matrix by the Euclidian method . The distance matrix provides the distance between two vectors such that it is implemented between the rows of the text matrix 14 . Once the distance between rows is computed , the resulting matrix is considered a matrix of dissimilarities. The distance , or dissimilarity, matrix does not necessarily calculate the literal distance between words and is a way to empirically evaluate the data. The rows of our text matrix are the stem word, so when the dissimilarity matrix is calculated , it is calculating the difference of the procedures based on the frequency of the word stems . This matrix can be represented graphically as a dendrogram , as seen in Fig. 4.']"," What specific methods were used to analyze the word stems, and what were the key findings of each method?"," The paper mentions several methods used to analyze word stems in the Results section, including Naive Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, heat map algorithms, Euclidean Hierarchical Clustering (EHC), correlation networks, and Bayesian discrete discriminant (BDD) analysis.  However, the paper focuses on providing details for EHC, correlation networks, and BDD. The authors explain that EHC uses a distance matrix based on the Euclidean method to calculate the dissimilarity between word stems, which is then visualized in a dendrogram. Correlation networks, as the name suggests, are used to model relationships between word stems based on their correlations. Finally, BDD analysis is employed to discriminate between different GOMS primitives based on the presence or absence of specific word stems. These analyses aim to identify which word stems are strongly associated with different GOMS primitives.",58,0.007092272,0.619066287

Stemming was also applied to reduce variations of similar words, such as ""charge,"" ""charging,"" and ""charged,"" into their base form ""charg,"" allowing for accurate word count analysis. Punctuation and numbers were eliminated to ensure consistent identification of words, as software would otherwise treat different punctuation marks or numbers as distinct entities. These strategies were essential to create a standardized, clean dataset for accurate and efficient analysis.",47,0.000318474,0.275411083
"The text you provided is likely from the **Methods** section of an academic paper. Here's why:

* **Data Acquisition and Preparation:** The text starts by describing how the data (procedural manuals) were obtained from a U.S. NPP (Nuclear Power Plant). It then explains the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, including:
    * Converting PDF files to text using software.
    * Formatting the text into different levels based on expert analysis.
    * Applying text mining techniques like stop word removal and stemming.
* **Analysis Methodology:** The text explains the decision to analyze the data at the fourth level for this specific research. It also describes the creation of a text matrix to analyze the frequency of word stems.

These elements are characteristic of the **Methods** section, where researchers detail the specific procedures they used to conduct their study. 

Let me know if you need further clarification or have any additional questions about this!",Text-Mining-for-Procedure-Level-Primitives-in-Human-Reliability-Analysis ,Text-Mining-for-Procedure-Level-Primitives-in-Human-Reliability-Analysis.pdf,academic paper,3,12,"['were acquired from a U.S. NPP 4 10 . The text was captured out of portable document format PDF files using the suite of Microsoft products, R 3.2.2 and SAS 9.3 11 12 . After the text was pulled from the PDF files , it was formatted into four different levels . These levels are defined by expert HRA analysts and will be referred to as a Levels 1 through 4 an example is pro vided in Table 2. For the purpose of analysis , the procedure manual was analyzed at the fourth level , because this is where most of the control room instructions are clearly defined . Additionally, t he fourth level is the level at which GOMS HRA most naturally translates . The seven different operation manuals contained more than 2,100 fourth level procedures. Table 2 is an example of the differing levels as defined in the NPP procedural manual regarding the main turbine . Table 2. An example of the levels of action s defined in the pr ocedural manual for the NPP main turbine . Procedural Manual Text Level s Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Instructions 6 Main turbine start up 6 6.1 Prerequisites 6 6.1 6.1.1 The feedwater system is i n service per feedwater and condensate. 6 6.1 6.1.1 6.1.1.1 The main turbine lube oil system is in service per main turbine lube oil system. 6 6.1 6.1.1 6.1.1.2 The generator seal oil system is in servic e per generator seal oil system 6 6.1 6.1.1 6.1.1.3 The main generator is filled with hydrogen per generator hydrogen. 6 6.1 6.1.1 6.1.1.4 The stator cooling system is in service per stator cooling system. 6 6.1 6.1.1 6.1.1.5 The stator cooling water system trips have been reset per stator cooling system. 6 6.1 6.1.1 6.1.1.6 These procedures were then altered into a format that is easier to text mine . This is completed via the removal of stop words these are typically conjunctive words that have little meaning when content is analyzed e.g., and, but, or, and with . Then each non conjunctive word in the man ual had the suffix removed this is called stemming. This is completed so that similar words would be counted as the exact same word . For example , charge , charging, ch arged, and charges would all be defined as differed words before stemming is completed after stemming , they are all charg . In addition to implementing stemming and stop word removal, all punctuation and numbers are removed as software identifies RCP s, RCPs , and RCPs as different from one another when no content difference exists . An example of stop word removal, stemming, and punctuation removal on a procedural step can be seen in Table 3. Once the text has been prepared , a text matrix is generated that identifies the number of times a word stem is in a sub section. The seven procedural manuals']"," Why was the fourth level of procedural manual text chosen for analysis, and how does this level relate to the GOMS HRA framework?"," The fourth level of the procedural manual was selected for analysis because it contains the most clearly defined control room instructions. This level aligns well with the GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) HRA framework, which aims to analyze human performance based on the cognitive processes involved in carrying out tasks. The fourth level's detailed instructions provide a more accurate representation of the steps involved in operating the system, making it easier to apply the GOMS framework for analysis.",50,0.000172751,0.479710542

As the HFE is parsed into finer units of analysis, it is critical that the mathematical underpinnings of the HRA methods be used for quantification. This research evaluated quantification assumptions of the SPAR H HRA method. With SPAR H comes the use of the HFE as a unit of analysis, which is problematic when modeling the dynamic evolution of the event. This lack of fine resolution can result in spurious HEPs when using SPAR H. Future efforts to develop a dynamic HRA approach will seek to refine these static methods for better application in dynamic contexts.

Static HRA supports probabilistic risk assessment PRA by considering the human contribution to overall system risk. HRA may be successfully integrated into PRA in a well established process Bell Swain, 1983 EPRI, 1992 IEEE, 1997 . The key to this integration is the human failure event HFE , which represents a clustering of human activities related to the operation of a particular system or component. The HFE can be quantified using any of a number of HRA methods for recent surveys, see Bell Holroyd, 2009 Chandler et al., 2006 and Kolaczkowski et al., 2005 . The HFE is integrated into the event trees used in the PRA. Often the clustering of activities under the HFE is done using fault tree logic. In practice, the HFE is defined as the entirety of human actions related to possible and relevant human interactions with a particular system. In other words, the HFE is defined top down, from the PRA level of interest, to encompass all human actions that can contribute to the fault of a component or system modeled in the PRA. Static HRA mimics the predominance of static PRA. The key point in static HRA and PRA is that events are analyzed for an assumed, typical window of time. The HFE for static HRA does not change as a function of time or the event progression the event sequences are fixed in the HRA, and the analysis represents a snapshot of time. Either the analysis represents a very generic context in which the event would occur, or the analysis is agnostic to time, meaning that time evolution is simply not factored into the calculation of the human error probability HEP . Therefore, other performance shaping factors PSFs apart from time drive the quantification of the HEP. Boring 2007 , among others, explains the conceptual shift from static HRA to dynamic HRA. Key aspects of this shift are the transition from predictions based on fixed or precoded models of accident sequences into predictions based on direct simulation of an accident sequence, with explicit consideration of timing of key events. For HRA to fit into this dynamic framework, its models must follow a parallel path, shifting away from estimating the probability of a static event, and into simulating the multitude of possible human actions relevant to an event. Traditional static HRA attempts to directly estimate or assign probabilities to pre defined HFEs. Example HFEs are failure to initiate feed and bleed and failure to align electrical bus to alternative feed. In the dynamic HRA framework, the focus shifts to simulating the human performance within a dynamic PRA framework and using the results of those simulations to assign the HEP.

CONCLUSION This exploration into dynamic subtask to HFE task translation has provide d examples of the process using the SPAR H method. Dynamic task modeling is very difficult to peruse thro ugh the framework of SPAR H distributions associated with each PSF need to be defined, and may change depending upon the scenario. However it is very unlikely that each PSF level is equally likely as the resulting HEP distribution is strongly centered at 100 , which is unrealistic. Continuous d istributions need to be identified for PSFs, to facilitate the transition to dynamic task modeling. Additionally discrete distributions n eed to be exchanged for continuous so that simulations for the dynamic HFE c an further advance. The SPAR H decomposition shows approximation methods median, average , max , multiplication and applying SPAR H to the sub task level so a time series could be built. Based on these results SPAR H quantification breaks down if the tas k level is not carefully controlled.

The thin black line is the whiskers in the boxplot going from the 25th to the minimum and the 75th to the maximum. Lastly the white dot in the thick black part of the box plot symbolizes the median. The images in Fig 2 and Fig 3 do not display a n exemplary violin plot, because t he data is so severely skewed. All analysis and graphical output were generated from R 2.2.3 Ref 9 . Additionally, some anomalies occur in the data . Such anomalies occur when a P SF multiplier is P F 1 and when a HEP is greater than 1, even when the adjustment factor from equation 3 is use. A PSF multiplier of P F 1 transpires in two PSFs available time and fitness for duty. A P F 1 automatically pu shes the HEP to 1 however , the approach to the aggregate functions in this case needs special consideration . In order to quantify P F 1, equation 2 is solved for the respective PSF. If P F 1 occurs for both available time and fitness for duty it is assumed that they have equal bearing on the impending failure. This is necessary so that the aggregate function s can be empirically evaluated. An exa mple of the quantification for the PSF multipliers is detailed in Table 2. Table 2. Example of how the multipliers are quantified when P F 1 is present for available time and fitness for duty.

The PSF multipliers remain at their original values and are not altered. An example of PSF multipliers producing an HEP greater than 1 is displayed in Table 3. Table 3.

The HEPs would have been 1.25 and 2.5 respectively. However the HEP is assumed to be 1, as a human action cannot have a failure li kelihood greater than 1 . Multiple tasks are often grouped as HFEs and SPAR H assumes the unit of analysis is the HFE. If HFE 1 is comprised of Tasks A, B, and C see Fig 1 , there are then several ways to calculat e the HFE based on a PSF multiplier or group of PSF multipliers. The maximum HFE calculation selects the largest PSF level values across three tasks . The assumption is that the analysis should capture the strongest manifestation of the PSF, even if the P SF changes across the evolution of the HFE. An example of this would be when a human reliability analyst decides to make a conservative or worst case estimation of the a changing set of tasks within a single HFE. This HFE is then repeated with each respective aggregate function being applied at the PSF level across three tasks for median, average, and multiplication. The methods are very similar to what intuition would produce when executed. The median takes the median PSF multiplier of three tasks. T he average, the average of three tasks, and the multiplication approach takes the product of three tasks for a single PSF.

The remaining FI events pre NPP, not displayed in Fig. 1, with steam generator tube rupture excluded. Results are presented by BWR and PWR NPP typ e alongside total for a 25 year period . Even with this standardization LOHS still remains at the highest rate of incidence for the total and BWRs category 3 and 5 events plant respectively . For the 65 PWRs the most frequent FI category is LOFW with 2 events per a plant. In order to make an assessment of plant type and FI category , an Analysis of Variance ANOVA test was applied to the FI events number of plants data. An ANOVA statistical test check s for a difference of means between several groups, assuming independence between groups and normality of residuals. The detailed results of the ANOVA test as displayed in table II . Table II. ANOVA results for the FI events number of plants by FI category and plant type.

The plant type is not identified as statistically significant p value 0.2 2 , however there is a practical significance based upon the visual inspection of the data. As seen in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, BWR FI NPP is greater than PWR in 6 out of 10 categories. In the SOV category alone, a BWR is almost 15 times more likely to experience an event. CONCLUSION FI groups are the NRC s standardized categorization of risk significant events that could impact the ability of a NPP to remove decay heat. An event must be linked to a reactor trip to be considered a FI. FI event categories were reviewed with consideration, for PWR and BWR, highlighting a general understanding of challenges and issues that commonly occur . The review of the FI groups by an ANOVA resulted in a statistically significant dif ference between FI categories and a practical difference between plant type s. Due to the fact that table I is the summary of 25 years, with roughly 99 plants active per a year 2,475 observations , there certainly are more rigorous analyses that could be applied to achieve a better understanding of the US NPP fleet . Many more in depth analyses and results are contained in 2, 8 with other analysis such as time series, event dependence, frequentist and Bayesian methods needing to be explored more fully. Results from these analysis can better inform plant and comp onent design, NPP simulations , strategize generation of additional backup actions.

The resulting distribution from all discrete dependence distributions of the human error from Task B is pictured in Figure 13 left. The discrete nature of this distribution is now apparent, where the bar between 0.9 1 is indicative of complete dependence and the bar 0.5 0.6 is clearly the high depende nce being expressed. Swain and Guttman 1983 described human error dependence as a continuum, not something to be discretized unfortunately, discrete behavior is clearly exemplified in Figure 13 left. Swain and Guttman originally described the frequency of zero dependence as uncommon between human tasks, p. 10 15 and complete dependence as unusual p. 10 18 . Further descriptions state, Complete dep endence between performances on two tasks is rare, but it not as rare as zero dependence Bell Swain, 1980 . Low dependence is assigned, if there is any doubt as to an assessment of ZD. This leaves the speculation that low, moderate, and high dependencies occur more frequently. The small range as well as low probability of human error for Task B in Figure 13 right is closer to the reality of a working N PP. In Figure 13 left, the results of each dependence level can easily be distinguished in the distribution of conditional THERP equations. The suggested form the THERP equations imply is to move away from the original discrete approach, with the addition of a continuous variable C to the equation 1 1 32 where P B is the probability of human error of Task B, and the value of C is expertly assigned on a range of 1 to 20.

Introduction,Proof-of-Concept Demonstrations for Computation-Based Human Reliability Analysis Modeling Operator Performance During Flooding Scenarios ,Proof-of-Concept Demonstrations for Computation-Based Human Reliability Analysis Modeling Operator Performance During Flooding Scenarios.pdf,academic paper,28,53,"['19 Swain and Guttman 1983 discuss three phases of quantification in THERP, which are largely mirrored in subsequent HRA methods Nominal HEP which is the default error rate corresponding to a particular task type, Basic HEP which is the nominal HEP modified for influences like PSFs on the basic performance, and Conditional HEP which is the basic HEP modified for dependence, the assumption that the error likelihood increases when an error condition is already underway. These three areas map also well to the three sections covered in this chapter, although in a slightly different order. It is also important to note that this chapter will not review assumptions about the nominal HEP. Rather, it is assumed that the nominal error rate tables provided in a method such as THERP are valid at the subtask level for which they were originally created. However, associated with each HEP is also a measure of uncertainty. The uncertainty discussion centers on statistical considerations associated with propagating uncertainty ove r a large number of units of analysis. This chapter does not focus exclusively on flooding events. Flooding, as discussed earlier, is only one of a number of different kinds of external events, but the findings should generalize to other types of events, from normal occurrences to off normal and severe accidents. The important point to note is that when modeling dynamic HRA, the granularity of analysis is finer than most static HRA methods. This chapter serves to test how conventional HRA methods scale to this level of precision, whether for flooding or other events. In order to determine whether HRA methods can be use to model flooding effects dynamically, they first need to model general phenomena dynamically.

Given these key differences between the Fuku shima Daiichi flood induced SBO, Hurricane Katrina and Fort Calhoun, there are no additional insights to be gained with respect to the immediate, post initiator actions operators need ed to take in response to these other flooding events. There are, however, a number of latent organizational challenges related to 1 the degree of disaster preparedness pre event, and 2 the long term capability to respond to the flooding event. For example, one parallel between Fukushima and Hurricane Katrina is the degree to which experts underestimated the extent of destruction nature can wrought. Decisions as to what type of flood protection should be built in New Orleans were influenced by cost considerations Rogers, Kemp, Bosworth, Seed, 2015 . Furthermore, misinterpretation of data resulted in a decrease in the reliability of the floodwalls surrounding New Orleans. Similar arguments could be made about the height of the sea wall protecting Fukushima Daiichi. Additionally, similar to Hurricane Katrina, the long term emergency response to the tsunami was complicated by several factors. According to the 2012 report by the National Diet of Japan Japan s bicameral legislature , emergency procedures and SAMGs for an SBO were not well developed due to th e perceived low probability of a tsunami of that magnitude occurring , and procedures from other countries e.g., United States c ould have been implemented prior to the earthquake. Having said this, the examination of latent organizational factors on human performance is outside the current scope of the RISMC modeling framework. The near term focus is on modeling the human perform ance of MCR and auxiliary operators in the hours and days post flooding, and the challenges they have to maintain adequate safety margin for the NPP.']",  What specific examples of latent organizational challenges related to disaster preparedness and long-term response capability are highlighted in the discussion?," The text points to two major latent organizational challenges: 1) underestimation of potential destruction and 2) inadequate preparedness for extreme events.  The example of Hurricane Katrina illustrates how cost considerations can lead to underestimation of the severity of flooding, resulting in insufficient flood protection.  Furthermore, the text suggests that misinterpretation of data regarding flood risk contributed to the failure of the New Orleans levees.  Similarly, the Fukushima Daiichi disaster underlines the importance of preparedness for extreme events, as the lack of well-developed procedures and preparedness for a tsunami of that magnitude hampered the long-term emergency response.",49,0.010043539,0.681087897

For example, as shown in Figure 7, since water is leaking under the door and is spraying in the room, if an action was required to move f rom this room into the adjacent room, PSFs would likely be judged not favorable, resulting in an increased human error probability HEP .

With the events that occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP site, flooding is also an important and timely topic to investigate from a risk management perspective. Flooding also has some similarities to other external events, such as earthquakes and fire NUREG 1921 , and so by studying flooding, this research also generates useful lessons and insights that can be applied to other external events. 2.2 The Effect of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami on Fukushima Daiichi On 11 March 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake occurred off the east coast of Japan, approximately 112 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant NPP , resulting in several tsunamis that inundated the Fukushima Daiichi site, and to a l esser degree 4 other nearby NPP sites IAEA, 2011 . Fukushima Daiichi NPP housed 6 Boiling Water Reactors BWRs . Prior to the earthquake, units 1, 2, and 3 were ope rating normally with off site power and were equipped with functioning emergency diesel generators EDGs and safety systems IAEA, 2011 INPO, 2011 Kadota, 2014 . Units 4, 5, and 6 were shut down for routine maintenance INPO, 2011 Kadota, 2014 . The earthquake, which lasted 3 minutes, exceeded the protection systems set points, causing units 1, 2, and 3 to automatically scram by inserting control rods to stop the fission reaction Kadota, 2014 . Additionally, the earthquake caused loss of off site power LOSP to all 6 units. In response to the LOSP, the EDGs started and provided power to the control rooms and the units to maintain reactor pressure, containment pressure, and reactor water level INPO, 2011 . Prior to the series of tsunamis, the saf ety systems operated as designed, and operators were able to safely maintain the reactors. The turbine buildings and reactors were located 10 meters above sea level Kadota, 2014 . The predicted maximum height for a tsunami was 6 meters, and, consequently , the protection for the units were built to that specification. Approximately 40 minutes after the earthquake, the first tsunami arrived at the site. The maximum wave height was approximately 14 15 meters leading to extensive flooding of the site. The tsunamis destroyed the EDGs or their electrical switchgear, and with no off site AC power, the site entered into station blackout SBO conditions . With the loss of all AC power, all safety and non safety systems driven by AC power became unavailable. The control room instrumentation and control I C systems and lighting requires DC power to operate, and unfortunately, the tsunami also flooded the DC distribution system and 125V DC batteries at units 1 and 2. The DC power distribution system and 125V DC batteries for unit 3 were available, but only for 30 hours because the battery s charger was flooded and AC power had not yet been restored. 2.3 Summary of Operator Response s With the loss of AC power, operating units 1, 2, and 3 had lost power to the systems that provided decay heat removal. With the loss of DC power in units 1 and 2, there was no power to the lighting or I C in the main control room.

PRA models are often just a predefined set of risks, treating any variability attributable to human actions e.g., differences in time to complete proceduralized actions as noise or error variance, when human actions, including errors of omission, can have large effects on overall risk by either significantly exacerbating or attenuating the severity of the failures of SSCs.

INTRODUCTION The United States U.S. Department of Energy DOE Light Water Reactor Sustainability LWRS program has the objective to develop technologies and other solutions that can improve the reliability, sustain the safety, and extend the life of current reactor s. To accomplish this objective, the LWRS program has the following program goals Develop the fundamental scientific basis to understand, predict, and measure changes in materials and systems, structures, and components SSCs as they age in environment s associated with continued long term operations of the existing reactors Apply this fundamental knowledge to develop and demonstrate methods and technologies that support safe and economical long term operation of existing reactors Research new technologies to address enhanced plant performance, economics, and safety To accomplish these program goals, there are multiple LWRS pathways, or research and development R D focus areas. One LWRS focus area is called the Risk Informed Safety Margi n Characterization RISMC Path way. Because safety analysis is an important element of sustainability and NPP decision making, a systematic approach to characterize safety margins is needed. The characterization of safety margins and risk is a vital input to the NPP owners and regulator in that it supports business and operational decision making. Characterization of risk is not new. Probabilistic risk assessment PRA or probabilistic safety assessment PSA have been a staple of NPP operations and regulatory oversight.

Discussion,MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF COLEOPTERA SPECTRAL REFLECTA ,MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF COLEOPTERA SPECTRAL REFLECTA.pdf,academic paper,37,40,"['Given the low error rates of misclassification, the multivariate statistical approaches outlined in this study are recommended for analysis of spectral reflectance in Coleoptera and other similar insect groups. However, it is noted that further research in this area should consider using a larger number of individual insects, as well as increasing the number of species analyzed. Also, extrapolation of results has to be practiced cautiously due to varying sensitivity of spectroscopy equipment. If practically feasible, utilizing insects from multiple museums is highly recommended. Incorporation of other Coleoptera attributes such as developmental stage, length, pheromones present, location and collection date might further improve the resolution of the classification techniques. Finally, it is recommended to obtain additional spectrometer readings in the ultraviolet spectrum because insects are sensitive to that spectrum and it may contain markings that are invisible to the human eye. 55 26th Annual Conference on Applied Statistics in Agriculture New Prairie Press http newprairiepress.org agstatconference 2014 Conference on Applied Statistics in Agriculture Kansas State University New Prairie Press https newprairiepress.org agstatconference 2014 proceedings 1']"," What specific limitations of the current study are highlighted in the Discussion section, and how do these limitations affect the generalizability of the findings?",  The Discussion section points out two key limitations: the relatively small sample size of individual insects and the limited number of species analyzed.

Introduction,MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF COLEOPTERA SPECTRAL REFLECTA ,MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF COLEOPTERA SPECTRAL REFLECTA.pdf,academic paper,4,40,"['The methods typically used for identification and classification of Coleoptera are often derived from antennal , tarsi, mouthparts labial and maxillary palpi , ventral characters sterna, pleura, coxae , and other morphological characteristics Choate 1999 . There is a high potential for misclassification that can occur in the process of identification. For example, long horned beetles which do not have long antennae, snout beetles which do not have snouts, ground beetles that live in trees, or aquatic beetles that are never in the vicinity of water Choate 1999 . Morphology of an insect has to be painstakingly analyzed in order to identify them accurately, i.e. antenna measured, veins on wings analyzed, carapace shape diagramed, etc. Memorizing or locating references for morphology and then applying that knowledge for the process of identification can be very time consuming.

In order to predict the class label of an unobserved 640 query point, qi, the knearest samples inT, which we will denote as pi 1,...,pi k, are identi ed. Each of the kneighbors is assigned a weight and votes for its observed label. The weight of the vote for pi jis given by the inverse Euclidean distance between qiandpi j. Similarly, we de ne nearest in terms of Euclidean orL2distance on the input space of the model being trained. 645 24']", How does the use of ROMs (Reduced Order Models) affect the accuracy of the analysis compared to using actual codes?," The text states that employing ROMs instead of actual codes decreased the statistical error of the analysis. This implies that ROMs, despite their potential for simplification, are able to accurately model the system behavior and achieve a desired level of accuracy. The use of a large number of simulation runs further reinforces this conclusion, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing statistical error.",49,8.41E-05,0.509457305

From Table 3 note that none of the recovery strategies are able to recovery PWR3 its condition at the beginning of the accident is the worst among the three units lost of CST inventory on top of SBO condition . From separate calculations, PWR3 could be saved only if EPE3 would be connected withing 470 the rst 50 minutes after SBO condition. Such condition, cannot be met given the boundary conditions of the accident progression. PWR1, on the other side, never reach CD condition this is due to the fact that CST inventory is intact compare to PWR3 and, thus, the time required to reach CD condition is much longer. In addition, PWR1 can be put in safe 475 condition through several ways see Section 4 . PWR2 and the SFPs appear to reach both CD and OK condition.

Introduction,Multi-Unit Dynamic PRA ,Multi-Unit Dynamic PRA.pdf,academic paper,1,31,"['Korea and Japan were several NPP sites include a large number of reactors 6, 7 or even 8 reactors . Worldwide about 80 plants have more than 2 reactors and 32 power plants have more than 3 reactors. 10 Following the accident event that occurred in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant 1 special attention has been given to multi unit plant sites. This attention has focused on the safety aspects of nuclear reactors that cannot be considered as entities isolated from each other. Historically, the rst multi unit Probabilistic Risk Analysis PRA at the 15 industry level has been performed for the Seabrook power station 2 using classical Probabilistic Risk Assessment PRA methods based on Event Tree ET and Fault Trees FT tools. Canada studies have been recently published about CANDU multi unit stations 3, 4 . Furthermore, the analysis of the safety aspects of multi unit plants has been performed for few selected cases 5, 6, 7 . 20 The objective of this paper is to propose the rst analysis of a multi unit power plant not by using classical ET FT tools 8 but by employing a simulation based i.e., Dynamic PRA 9 approach the Risk Informed Safety Margin Characterization RISMC approach 10, 11 . The rationale behind this choice is that great modeling improvements can be achieved by employing sys 25 tem simulators instead of static Boolean structures like ETs FTs. Accident dynamic is in fact not set a priori by the analyst like in an ET FT structure but it is entirely simulated given a set of initial and boundary conditions. Note that timing and sequencing of events are implicitly modeled in the analysis along with interactions between accident evolution and system dynamics. 30 Modeling limitations of ETs FTs based methods are even more limiting when dealing with multiple complex systems that are coupled to each other. In fact, the presence of shared systems and structures among the units provides additional degrees of freedom in the accident progression temporal evolution.

These jumps represent abrupt changes in the complexity multiplier likely due to significant transitions in the system's state. The decrease in slope between LOOP and LODG is attributed to the decrease in coolant temperature and reactor power, while the increase in slope after LODG is linked to the rise in coolant temperature. These relationships suggest that the complexity multiplier responds directly to changes in these critical parameters. ",58,0.04134738,0.614539936

Determine is an abstract procedure level primitive that can be decomposed into three verify substeps.

In order to reach a steady state condition, the simulation is be ing run for 500 seconds without any change in its internal parameters. At 500 ,the external initiating event i.e., eart hquake caused a LOOP event. The reactor successfully scrams, AC power is provided by the DGs and the ECCS keeps the reactor core cool. At 2000 ,the tsunami induced flooding disables th e DGs which were providing emergency AC power. Without AC power, the E CCS is disabled as well and th e core temperature increases.']"," What is the specific impact of the tsunami-induced flooding on the simulated reactor system, and what are the key safety systems affected?"," The tsunami-induced flooding disables the DGs, which were providing emergency AC power.  This loss of AC power in turn disables the ECCS (Emergency Core Cooling System), leading to a rise in core temperature.  This scenario highlights the critical need for robust and redundant power systems in nuclear reactors, particularly those located in areas susceptible to natural disasters.",43,0.003716424,0.3205811

QUANTIFYING THE HUMAN ERROR PROBABILITY 6.1 Generic Approach to Quantification Quantification of the human error probability is one of the primary objects of HRA as it used toassess the performance of human actions within the context of safety. As previously noted in this report, the general approach to HRA entails th ree interrelated components, which are identify possible sources of error, model those errors with in the context of the system, and quantify those errors Boring, 2009 . Quantifying the errors typically includes providing a probabilistic description of the likelihood for the errors to occur. The quantificati on process makes use of nominal HEPs, which are base error likelihoods for a generic task type, such as closing a valve. These nominal HEPs are intenti onally formulated to describe generic human actions to support their application to many different tasks. Generic HEPs serve as the basic toolset of HRA quantification in which the contex t of the task can be layered upon to tailor these generic HEPs to highly specific tasks. Since errors occur within the context of the system and operating situation, PSFs capture the nuances of the sp ecific task and modify the nominal HEP by integrating these contextual factors that affect performance. The multiplication of the generic nominal HEPs and the task specific PSFs yield s the overall HEP value. PSFs can both improve or hinder operator performance as can be seen be low in Figure 14. The task specific overall HEP value provides a comprehensive quan tification of the task and can then be used to make risk related decisions.

Autocalculation of the overall HEPs is needed to capture the dynamics of human error while the simulation is running. For example, we are currently modeling the effects of complexity as it evolve s dynamically see Chapter 5 . As complexity increases, so should the HEP. Importantly, comple xity changes as the modeled event progresses and evolves by increasing or decreasing the HEP for any subtask or slice of time accordingly. The change occurs relative to the nominal HEP value. Indeed, one of the primary reasons for decomposing subtasks into a GOMS structure is to define the Operators as the basis for the HEP.']", What is the advantage of the HUNTER approach's ability to autocalculate HEPs?," The HUNTER approach aims to automatically calculate HEPs based on contextual information, which allows for a more dynamic and accurate representation of human error within simulations.

MODELING PERFORMANCE SHAPING FACTORS 5.1 Complexity Complexity is included in most HRA methods as pa rt of the quantification of the HEP. This fits well with our intuitive understanding of complexity and the role it can have in the likelihood of successfully conducting a task. Complexity is however a multifaceted concept and there are challenges in finding or creating a fitting operationalization.In Rasmussen et al. 2015 a task complexity mo del containing six factors goal , size , step , dynamic , structure and connection complexity wa s presented as part of the work in creating the Petro HRA method, in which HRA was adapte d for use in the oil and gas industry see Laumann et al., 2014, for an overview of the pr oject . The work by Rasmussen et al. 2015 initially examined 13 complexity factors, with seven subsequently being excluded procedure ,temporal , knowledge , human machine interface H MI , interaction and variation complexity and uncertainty . The main reason for the exclus ion was overlap with other PSFs in the Petro HRA method. For a detailed description of the f actors and the literature they are based on, see Rasmussen et al. 2015 . 5.2 Complexity in Traditional HRA As described in Section 2.1, ma ny traditional static HRA me thods use the quantification approach in which generic task types are adap ted to the specific situation though PSFs that increase or decrease the estimated HEP. Complexity is often directly accounted for through task types being described as comple x or through a specific complexity PSF. Some of the complexity sources are also implicitly included as part of the modeling of the task. For example, a complex task can be modeled as taking longer to execute in the timeline analysis than simpler tasks and thereby also influencing other parts of th e analysis outside of the HEP quantification. 5.3 Advantages of Modeling Complexity in CBHRA As CBHRA allows a scenario to develop base d upon a computation instead of following a scripted path, complexity is not included in the HRA model in the same way as it is in traditional static HRA. Instead, some of the simulations will develop in such a way that the complexity expands, while others will follow paths with reduced complexity levels. This will allow CBHRA to better model scenarios that could develop in many ways, with numerous different correct response option pathways and various acceptabl e outcomes or include richer pathways comprised of aspects such as recovery actions in which steps must be redone correctly to achieve the desired outcome.A primary advantage of dynamically modeling complexity in CBHRA is that a task can have more than one output. Instead of only providing a direct contribution to the HEP for a single event tree, it can provide an influence to path choices and reshape the event tree which will also elicit influence on the dynamically changing HE P as some paths will lead to additional non desired results and to time spent on the task which will also influence the HEP dynamically as most scenarios possess some finite time limit for actions to be effective . CBHRA would also']", What are the challenges associated with operationalizing the concept of complexity in Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) methods?," The text highlights that complexity is a multifaceted concept, making it challenging to find or create a fitting operationalization. It mentions that while complexity is intuitively understood, it's difficult to capture its various aspects in a way that can be effectively used in HRA models. This difficulty arises because complexity encompasses multiple factors, such as goal complexity, step complexity, and dynamic complexity, making it hard to define and measure consistently.",51,6.66E-05,0.377578014

The SHERPA error types are manifestati ons of these generic task types xActions A Performing required physical actions on the control boards A C or in the field A F xChecking C Looking for required inform ation on the control boards C C or in the field C F xRetrieval R Obtaining required information on the control boards R C or in the field RF xInstruction Communication I Producing verbal or written instructions I P or receiving verbal or written instructions I R xSelection S Selecting or setting a value on the control boards S C or in the field S F xDecisions D Making a decision based on procedures D P or without available procedures D W Note that Operators with an uppercase O ar e units of analysis in GOMS, while operators with a lowercase o are the individuals who control the plant. The GOMS HRA Operators generally distinguis h between control room actions and field actions, the latter of which may be performed by ROs working as balance of plant operators or by technicians and field workers. Note that reading procedures qualifies as receiving written instructions I R . Selection S may involve digital or an alog technologies. It is not completely orthogonal to Action A and represents a specifi c type of Action commonl y performed at plants. Checking C is likewise a specific type of Retrieval R and may find considerable overlap. Decision D is analogous to the M Operator in KLM, except it is important to delineate a decision predicated by a procedure flow whe re the decision outcomes are clearly understood and those made outside procedure space where the decision outcomes are not always clearly understood .

The empirical data consists of simulator logs recorded by an observer shadowing a crew of operators during a series of turbine control scenario simulations. The simulator logs provi ded a detailed account of each procedure step, relevant actions, completion times for those actions, and crew communications. The simulator logs contained a total of 283 obser vations spanning five separate scenarios, each of which lasted']", What type of data was used to quantify the task primitive completion times for the GOMS HRA model?,"  The authors used empirical data collected from a series of operator-in-the-loop studies as part of a control room modernization project.

HUMAN RELIABILITY SUBTASK PRIMITIVES 4.1 GOMS HRA 4.1.1 IntroductionOne of the challenges in dynamic HRA is the f act that most HRA methods quantify at the overall task i.e., HFE level while subtask quantification will often be required for the dynamic HRA to best follow the scenario as it develops. In an attempt to overcome this challenge, we developed a new HRA approach through categorizing subtas ks and linking them to HEPs Boring Rasmussen, 2016 . This chapter introduces this approach. Although we present a new HRA approach, it bridges several existing concep ts from other HRA methods. The purpose of developing this new approach was to allow us to anchor our analyses on subtasks as required by CBHRA, because existing HRA methods did not i n the authors views adequately address subtask analysis.4.1.2 The GOMS MethodThe Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules GOMS method wa s first developed by Card, Moran, and Newell 1983 . Goals represent the high level tasks the human seeks to complete, Operators are the available actions the human can take, Methods are the steps or subgoals the human takes toward completing Goals, and Selection rules are the decisions the humans make. GOMS has been used extensivel y in human factors as a way to model proceduralized activities. It shares underpinning s with task analysis in that it breaks human actions into a series of subtasks.

Specifically, SPAR H analyzes the impact of available time to complete the task on the HEP. A shorter window of time degrades the operators performan ce or at least their ability to complete the task successfully. The modeling of time as a PSF is, however, not the same as dynamic HRA. Time, as modeled in SPAR H and other HRA methods, is dynamically invariant for the HFE. For the specific HFE being analyzed, the analyst will not typically l ook at a range of time windows or how that time window changes throughout alternate event evol utions. Time, in static HRA, is simply a snapshot of an available resource the operator need s, which is firmly fixed in a predefined HFE in the PRA.The preceding discussion has centered on HFE modeling and HEP quantification for conventional HRA, which are sta tic in nature. Once the overall system is modeled, including HFEs, the HFEs do not change as a result of th e event progression. Dynamic HRA does not rely on a fixed set of event and fault trees to model event outcome. Rather, it builds the event progression dynamically, as a result of ongoin g actions Acosta Siu, 1993 .

The chapters correspond to different modeling modules and are as follows xChapter 2 provides background on HRA and, spec ifically, the necessary transition from traditional, static HRA methods to dy namic or computa tion based methods xChapter 3 provides background on RAVEN, which is used as the control logic driver for the thermo hydraulic code RELAP 7 used in the nuclear power plant simulations for the demonstration in this report']", What are the limitations of current HRA approaches that HUNTER aims to address?,"  The text states that HUNTER was created to address the limitations of current HRA approaches by incorporating HRA into areas where it has not been represented before and reducing uncertainty by accounting for human performance more accurately. This suggests that current HRA approaches are not comprehensive enough and lack accuracy in representing human performance, leading to uncertainty in risk assessments.",59,0.000255973,0.434439615

However, as the probability of event ""B"" increases, the probability of event ""A"" increases at a faster rate, eventually reaching a point where the dependence becomes stronger. This pattern highlights that human failure event dependence can be significant, but it also suggests that there might be limits to this dependence.

This means the rate of event s is less than 0.002, and anomalous behavior may occur in the GaP distribution when fit, due to the rate being so low. The GaP distribution is applied to the data, rather than providing just a rate estimate, so that a confidence interval can be built. And in some cases , the rate of events is so low that the distribution and the confidence intervals become unstable. When the distribution has been identified as unstable, the prior belief used on the distribution is changed until a stable distribution is ident ified. Stable results are input into computer software such as SAPHIRE 8 to provide estimates for the likelihood of events at the plant level.2 The propagation of uncertainty on component behavior to systems and whole NPPs is what is being captured by the GaP distribution . II. EMPERICAL BAYES EB The EB GaP distributions with small alphas are considered unstable , because typically the variance , or uncertainty, is larger than the estimated mean, or rate, of the distribution . This is because there']"," What are the limitations of the current methodology for estimating nuclear power plant failure rates, and what is the proposed solution presented in the paper?"," The current methodology for estimating nuclear power plant failure rates using the empirical Bayes method with GaP distribution faces issues.  The algorithms used to solve for parameters lack consistency, and accurately determining the variance of each parameter presents a challenge. The paper proposes a new approach utilizing the method of moments for a negative binomial distribution to address these limitations. This approach offers a closed form estimation for mean and variance of each parameter, providing a more reliable and consistent solution.",56,0.000129293,0.600905049

Collaborations between theo retical and experimental research have shown great success at understanding catalytic pro cesses173,174and discovering new catalytic ma terials.70,181However, the integration of infor mation is often qualitative or semi quantitative, and typically happens through an arduous pro cess of in person meetings, email exchanges, and phone calls. Experimentalists and theo reticians rarely exchange raw data, and any data exchange typically happens well after theexperiments calculations have been completed. Further, there are numerous examples of su per cial agreement between theory and ex periment which do not hold up to scrutiny we omit citations, but expect that anyone fa miliar with the literature is aware of exam ples . Catalysis informatics has the poten tial to improve these weaknesses through at least two approaches improved data infrastruc ture and probabilistic frameworks. The rst challenge is primarily practical, since the tech nology to immediately upload data to cloud based infrastructure is well established, and is increasingly used by industrial labs.322In addition, e collaboration platforms to facil itate rapid transfer of data and communica tion are also being developed in the materials informatics community.30,97Similar approaches could be adopted by catalysis researchers to enable rapid, or even real time, integration of data from diverse theoretical and experimen tal sources. This holds particular promise for techniques that rely on mathematically inten sive analysis such as TAP256,258or MES.243,244 Transient kinetic techniques are presently un derutilized but these rich data sources can pro vide direct connection to micro kinetic model parameters calculated from DFT. This exper imental data should be utilized for model re duction, decreasing the parameter set and guid ing atomistic calculations making the dialog be tween researchers more productive.

Introduction,Extracting knowledge from data through catalysis informatics ,Extracting knowledge from data through catalysis informatics.pdf,academic paper,19,53,"['processes may inform model construction in a top down approach, and qualitative comparison to macro scale kinetics is critical to assess and validate bottom up models. However, some ap proaches do seek to quantitatively bridge the gap,167,271 273often with the use of statistical models this is an emerging and important area for catalysis informatics. The idea of constructing and parameteriz ing kinetic models is far from new. Kinetic models have been central to catalysis from the early days, including power law kinetics with no molecular insight, Langmuir Hinshelwood Hougen Watson LHHW models that require some chemical intuition, and micro kinetic models that link directly to elementary pro cesses.72,89,274The most basic realization of a ki netic model is the Arrhenius equation, which is routinely parameterized using Arrhenius plots. More advanced approaches utilize non linear re gression to establish the parameters of LHHW and or micro kinetic models. These param eter estimation approaches could be consid ered early informatics approaches, but have been covered extensively in previous reviews and texts.72,101Similarly, the use of compu tational methods primarily DFT to provide energetics of elementary processes to param eterize kinetic models from the bottom up is well established.173,174Here we focus on exten sions of these approaches that include statistical models and or uncertainty quanti cation. Reaction mechanism The rst step to es tablishing a micro kinetic model is determina tion of the set of di erential equations from the underlying chemical reaction mechanism. This step is far from trivial, as reaction networks grow exponentially with the number of atoms in the largest molecule.28,89This complexity is exacerbated for surface reactions, where the possibility of multi site mechanisms and cov erage e ects can lead to even more possibili ties.41,86In practice, the reaction mechanism is often determined from a combination of quali tative analysis of experimental data and chem ical intuition however, as reaction mechanisms and catalyst surfaces become more complex these intuitive approaches become impracticalso automated, systematic techniques must be employed. There are two general approaches to systematic mechanism construction local and global. Local approaches start from a set of reactants and iteratively construct, pa rameterize, and solve the di erential equations corresponding to all possible next elementary steps. The results are used to identify the most relevant steps, and the algorithm iterates forward through the reaction network, grow ing a core of relevant reactions and discard ing all reactions that are deemed improba ble. This approach has been used extensively and successfully in the combustion chemistry community28,88,275and a version of the Reac tion Mechanism Generator RMG has recently been adapted to surface reactions suggesting that this is a promising route to model con struction.276These approaches inherently rely on data science methods since elementary step enumeration and model parameterization hap pens on the y. The determination of elemen tary steps uses graph theory and the rapid pa rameterization requires databases of known pa rameter values as well as models for quickly predicting the values of unknown parameters.28 Local mechanism construction approaches are e cient because they avoid irrelevant regions of the reaction network, and are advantageous because they deliver a simpli ed and parame terized model that can be further re ned using additional experimental or computational data. The main disadvantage of local model genera tion is the reliance on accurate on the y pa rameterization. Inaccurate parameters can lead to incorrect mechanisms, and the unavailability of accurate adsorption and transition state en ergies for surface reactions makes this particu larly challenging for heterogeneous catalysis. The global approach to model construction avoids this problem by rst considering all ele mentary steps connecting reactants to products and subsequently relying on parameterization to simplify the model. Global approaches are more comprehensive, but they are also less ef cient since they sample all possible elemen tary steps rather than just the most proba ble ones, leading to a combinatorial explosion of complexity as the size of the reaction net 19']", What are the limitations of traditional kinetic modeling approaches in catalysis?," Traditional kinetic models, such as power law kinetics and LHHW models, often lack molecular insight or require significant chemical intuition. Additionally, these models are not always capable of quantitatively bridging the gap between microscopic and macroscopic scales. This limitation highlights the need for more advanced modeling approaches, like those incorporating statistical models and uncertainty quantification.",48,1.12E-06,0.365605106

One major route to obtaining atomic scale insight in catalysis is electronic structure the ory, most commonly based on DFT. Computa tional models can provide detailed insight into the energetics of molecules binding at surfaces, and these quantities are critical for understand ing the structure environment property link ages in catalysis.4,69,70,173,174However, DFT cal culations are also computationally expensive, and this cost can become prohibitive in the con text of high throughput studies. Hence, numer ous methods based on physical, chemical, and data driven models have been explored to de velop quantitative linkages between the molecu lar electronic structure of catalyst surfaces and the associated adsorption energy of intermedi ate molecules. A classic example of a physically derived cor relation between catalyst electronic structure is thed band model175,176and associated adsorp tion energy scaling relations .177These linear correlations between the binding energies of various intermediates drastically reduce the number of calculations needed to predict cat alyst activity, and have spurred the growth of computational catalyst screening studies that will be discussed later Sec. 2.3.2 . While these original correlations were physically derived only for transition metal surfaces, many other linear and non linear relationships between ad sorption energies and electronic structure pa rameters have been developed for a wide range of materials classes.178 182These descriptor based approaches predict adsorption and or transition state energies based on a few easily obtainable inputs such as electronic structure parameters,175,178,183 189 generalized coordi nation numbers,137,190 194or other adsorption energies 136,177,179,180,195,196several examples are shown in Fig. 4a b. They are typically semi empirical, and increasingly employ machine learning techniques.14,17,197Recent work has also demonstrated that statistical analysis can be used to identify optimal descriptors.198These descriptors are based primarily on the properties of the catalyst surface material, and the parameters of the model vary with as the adsorbate changes. For small molecules the model itself is relatively simple, but for larger molecules and or more complex active site geometries group additivity28,89,138,199 204 Fig. 4c and bond order conservation205 207 approaches can be used. Other studies have utilized informatics techniques such as compres sive sensing,208,209graph theory,16and regres sion210to accelerate the process of constructing and parameterizing models for treating lateral adsorbate adsorbate interactions. This combi nation of techniques provides a route to utilize known data of binding energies of an adsor bate on a number of catalyst surfaces in order to rapidly predict the binding energy of the same or similar adsorbate on new materi als, di erent active sites, or di erent coverage conditions. An alternative approach to accelerating the calculation of adsorption energies is to use the molecular structures as inputs rather than de scriptors. The atomic structure can be n gerprinted using numerous techniques that quantify the local environment of individual atoms11,31,212,213or properties of the entire sys tem.214These ngerprints serve as inputs to re gression models such as neural networks, ker nel ridge regression, or Gaussian process re gression.

Discussion,Extracting knowledge from data through catalysis informatics ,Extracting knowledge from data through catalysis informatics.pdf,academic paper,10,53,"['and stability are even less well de ned than ac tivity, and it is all too common to nd data in the literature that cannot be directly compared due to di ering de nitions and lack of detail in how these metrics are computed where possi ble raw concentration vs. time data should be recorded and stored along with catalytic reac tion metrics. Comprehensive guidelines for re porting catalytic reaction data are beyond the scope of this work, but have been discussed elsewhere.106 108In the context of informatics we note that as data infrastructure improves it will become increasingly easy to store raw and derived catalytic data along with the appropri ate meta data, and this will facilitate improved performance in informatics approaches. 2.2 Information Data is transformed to information by analy sis to extract patterns and quanti able relation ships using statistical and or physical models here we focus primarily on statistical and data driven models. In the context of catalysis infor matics, we consider information to be derived data or patterns that do not rely on the chemi cal master equation and do not directly address questions of active site or reaction mechanism. This information can be broadly classi ed into two levels macro scale information and micro scale information. Macro scale information does not rely on a fundamental or atomic scale perspective, but rather seeks a direct empiri cal relation between some macro scale descrip tor of catalyst process structure and the re sulting catalytic performance in terms of ac tivity, selectivity, stability, etc. In contrast, micro scale information is focused on under standing the fundamental interactions between a catalyst surface and the adsorbed interme diate species that exist during the process of catalysis however, this information does not directly relate to the practical catalytic perfor mance.

These data types are essential because they relate to the microscopic interactions between the catalyst's active sites and molecules (surface science) and the macroscopic observations of the resulting interactions (catalytic reaction). This understanding of both micro and macro scales is vital for comprehensively analyzing catalytic behavior.,70,3.59E-05,0.665231038

We propose that there are four types of data relevant to catalysis data on the chemical envi ronment, data on the catalyst material, data on the active surface, and data on reaction kinet ics. The latter two types are unique to catalysis, and are related to the micro scale interactions between the catalyst active sites and molecules surface science , and macro scale observations of the results of these interactions catalytic re action . We brie y describe some representa tive data of each type collected in Table 2 , and discuss relevant meta data. In general data should be stored along with meta data clearly describing the device used to measure it, the protocols employed, and the units in which it is measured. By associating this meta data with the relevant data, the veracity of catalysis data can be greatly improved. Data on the chemical environment describe in essence the chemical potentials of product and reactant species that are not bound to the cat alyst surface. This includes the reaction con ditions temperature, pressure, concentrations, illumination, applied potential, etc. , as well as the nature and concentrations of the reactants and products. These data also include the ther mochemical properties of product and reactantspecies, solvents, electrolytes, or other spec tator species these data are readily available from sources such as the NIST Webbook112or PubChem database113for many common chem ical species. In recording chemical environ ment data for speci c catalytic reactions it is worth considering the devices that are used to measure the data. For example, product con centrations are often measured with analytical techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry GC MS or nuclear magnetic resonance NMR . There are often implicit as sumptions made in the analysis of this raw data to determine product concentration e.g. cali bration curves . Any such assumptions should be noted as meta data for concentrations, and where possible the raw data should be stored as well. Another key consideration for chemi cal environment data is the fact that it is often measured at the macro scale, while the micro scale environment is most relevant to the cat alytic phenomena. The di erence between the two is typically due to thermal and mass trans port, and in general the micro scale chemical environment will not be spatially homogeneous. For this reason it is key that data on temper ature, ow rate, and pressure include details of the devices and protocols used to measure them. Ideally the corresponding catalytic reac tion data can be utilized to assess the in uence of these transport e ects. Data on the material describe the static prop erties of the catalyst material that are indepen dent of the reaction environment. This primar ily corresponds to the bulk properties of the catalyst material, but may also include char acterizations such as particle size distribution, surface area, or dopant concentration. We note that in practice these properties may change during the reaction, but such changes would 8']", How does the variety and volatility of catalysis data impact data storage and organization challenges?,  The text highlights how the diversity and constantly changing nature of catalysis data makes it difficult to create a comprehensive list of data types or propose standardized storage methods. It emphasizes the need to consider basic data types and their specific purposes within the context of catalysis research instead of attempting to capture all possible data variations. ,58,8.04E-06,0.581897695

This represents a clear def inition, and emphasizes the fact that the micro kinetic model is the mathematical link connect ing the state variables of the system temper ature, pressure, etc. , intrinsic parameters of a catalytic surface e.g. equilibrium and rate con stants , the chemical reaction mechanism, and the observed global reaction rate. Given an ac curate kinetic model it is possible to generalize the behavior of a catalytic material 72,88thus we concur with Caruthers et. al. that the ki netic model is a quantitative representation of knowledge about the catalytic system. 66 These proposed boundaries between data, in formation, and knowledge are fuzzy the ne details that distinguish these categories are less critical than the broad ideas which will serve as a basis for the following sections.

The following sections discuss the various com ponents of this continuum to describe how data ows to knowledge through the process of conceptualization and model construction, and how this knowledge can be used to generate new hypotheses. Testing these new hypotheses leads to an expansion of available data, and enables model re nement.

Introduction,Extracting knowledge from data through catalysis informatics ,Extracting knowledge from data through catalysis informatics.pdf,academic paper,2,53,"['geneous catalytic materials which have a num ber of unique challenges. We note that infor matics approaches are also relevant to homoge neous18,23and biological catalysts 24however, these applications are largely covered by the ex isting elds of cheminformatics25,26and bioin formatics27respectively. Furthermore, we focus primarily on methods that are unique to the challenges of heterogeneous catalysis. Chem informatics or chemometrics has been estab lished for decades25and involves the extrac tion of knowledge from molecular structures that are relevant to the chemical products, re actants, and intermediates of catalytic reac tions.28The eld of materials informatics is also relatively well established,29,30and ad dresses properties of solid materials that may act as catalysts. Similarly, atomistic infor matics approaches such as machine learning force elds31,32and large databases of atomic structures properties33,34have recently become prevalent. While all of these elds are relevant to heterogeneous catalysis, they are not unique to it and will only be discussed in situations where there is signi cant overlap. The eld of heterogenous catalysis has several unique attributes that make it particularly chal lenging from an informatics perspective, and for these reasons we argue that catalysis in formatics is a necessary addition to the exist ing zoo of informatics sub elds. For one, the phenomenon of heterogeneous catalysis involves the interaction of a molecule with a solid sur face. These systems are often treated as dis tinct in informatics approaches molecules are discrete entities and many solid surfaces are pe riodic. Di erent mathematical descriptions are often employed to describe these fundamentally di erent types of atomic scale systems. This is sue persists at the macro scale, where catalytic properties depend on both the material sur face structure and the chemical environment in which the catalyst is operating. Thus, catal ysis informatics lies at the intersection of ma terials informatics and cheminformatics. This fact breaks the traditional process structure property paradigm of materials informatics, since the relevant surface structure will be linked to both the structure of the solid surfaceand the chemical potential of gas phase species in the reaction environment 35for this reason we propose process structure environment property relationships that are more appropri ate for catalysis see Fig. 1 . Furthermore, heterogeneous catalysis is an inherently local surface phenomenon, often controlled by de fects, typically with sizes on the order of a few angstr om.36 39This leads to a situation in which easily measured bulk properties e.g. composition are not directly related to cat alytic properties although indirect correlations are possible 40since the composition of the sur face termination is often di erent from that of the bulk. These properties lead to a featuriza tion challenge in catalysis, referring to the fact that it is di cult to identify the salient features that control the catalytic behavior of a material at both the atomic and macro scales. CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT SURFACE STRUCTUREPROCESS PROPERTY Figure 1 Schematic of process structure environment property relationship for catalysis.

AGR 2 has the largest sample size (N=60), followed by AGR 3 (N=24), and AGC 2 has the smallest sample size (N=17). This variation in sample size implies different levels of statistical power for each experiment. The larger sample sizes in AGR 2 and AGR 3 allow for more reliable estimates of the population parameters and potentially more robust statistical inferences.",44,0.000220212,0.198637721

INTRODUCTION A series of fuel irradiation experiments have been conducted in the Advanced Test Reactor ATR at Idaho National Laboratory INL to support the li censing and operation of the Advanced Reactor Technologies ART high temperature gas cooled re actor HTGR . The Advanced Gas Reactor AGR Fuel Development and Qualification experiments are comprised of multiple independent capsules containing multiple cylindrical fuel compacts, placed inside of a graphite holder in the ATR. The AGR experiments provide data on fuel performance under i rradiation and potential acci dent conditions, support fuel process development, qualify the fuel for norma l operating conditions, provide irradiated fuel for potential accident testing, and support the developmen t of fuel performance and fission product transport models. In parallel, a series of graphite irradiation expe riments have been conducted at ATR to support the design of graphite core components for HTGRs. Th e Advanced Graphite Creep AGC experiments use matched pairs of stressed and unstressed graphite specimens to assess the effects of irradiation on dimensional and thermomechanical properties. To date , six irradiation campaigns have been completed AGR 1 December 2006 November 2009 AGR 2 June 2010 October 2013 AGR 3 4 December 2011 April 2014 AGC 1 September 2009 January 2011 AGC 2 April 2011 May 2012 and AGC 3 November 2012 April 2014 . The fuel compacts in AGR 1, 2, and 3 4 are composed of tristructural isotropic TRISO coated fuel particles and A3 matrix material. The TRISO sphere s are a uranium material mixture encased in buffer, dense inner pyrolytic carbon IPyC , silicon carbide SiC , and dense outer pyrolytic carbon OPyC layers 1 . The SiC layer provides structural in tegrity and retains fission products at elevated temperatures. The fuel particles are then pressed into a cylindrical shape with the matrix material filling in the spaces between the TRISO fuel spheres. The TRISO fuel particles are structures that do not change dimensions when irradiated, and their purpose is to co ntain the fuel. The matrix is composed of resin and graphite in weight percent the matrix is 80 Asbury and Graphtech graphites, 20 Hexion SD 1708 high purity phenolic resin with 8 He xa. The matrix is then pressed and h eated with the fuel particles to 1800 C, inside of a cylinder form 2 . Graphite composes a majority of the fuel compacts, and has been utilized in the nuclear industry for over 60 years. Graphite is chosen as a moderator in pa rt due to its low coefficient of thermal expansion and its high thermal conductivity, which together prov ide excellent resistance to thermal shock. Based on the properties of graphite when temperatures greater than 1000 C are reached, the molecular bonds between graphite molecules are strengthened 3 . This additional strength is critical as during irradiation, fast neutrons cause damage to the crystal structure, le ading to distortion and cracking of the graphite 4 . Dimensional changes in AGR fuel compacts are im portant because the swelling or shrinkage affects the size of the gas gaps that are used to control te mperatures. Analysis of dimensional changes in the AGR fuel compacts is necessary to establish the si gnificant factors impacting compact shrinkage. Based on the availability of post irradiation data , 162 AGR 1, 2, and 3 4 fuel compacts were considered for inclusion in the analysis. Additionall y, 17 AGC 2 graphite only specimens were identified for inclusion in this analysis. These specimens were selected because they were machined from the same graphite matrix material A3 used in the AGR fuel compacts, were measured post irradiation, and were not subjected to mechanical stress. For the sake of simplicity, the word compact will be used to collectively refer to both the AGR fuel compacts and the AGC specimens throughout this report.

Dimensional change in AGR fuel compacts is vital because the swelling or shrinkage affects the size of the gas ga ps that are used to control temperatures. Analysis of dimensional change in the AGR fuel compacts is needed to establish the variables directly relating to compact shrinkage. The variables initially identified for consideration were matrix density, compact density, fuel packing fraction, ur anium loading, fuel particle diameter, cumulative fast neutron fluence, and volume average time average fuel temperature. In addition to the data available from the AGR experiments, the analysis included specimens formed from the same A3 matrix material used in Advanced Graphite Creep AGC experiment s, which provide graphite creep data during irradiation for design and licensing purposes. The primary purpose of including the AGC specimens was to encompass dimensional behavior at zero packing fraction, zero uranium load ing, and zero particle diameter. All possible combinations of first order variable regressions were considered in the analysis. The study focused on iden tifying the best regression models for percent change in diameter, length, and volume. Bootstrap analysis was used to ensure the resulting regression models were robust and well performing. The variables identified as very significant in predicting change in one or more dimensions diameter, length, and vol ume are volume average time average temperature, fast fluence, compact dens ity, packing fraction and fuel particle diameter. Due to the presence of confounding effects between several variables, interpretation of these results is equivoca l the use of multiple statistical tests provides additional confidence in the conclusion.']", What specific types of AGR experiments were conducted and what was the goal of these experiments?, The abstract states that a series of Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) experiments were conducted in the Advanced Test Reactor at Idaho National Laboratory. The objective of these experiments was to support the qualification and development of tristructural isotropic fuel. This means they aimed to understand the behavior of this fuel type under reactor conditions.,67,0.001285317,0.541614528
